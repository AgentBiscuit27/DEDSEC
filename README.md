# DEDSEC AUTOTYPER

DEDSEC is a fun little virus that will autotype "THIS IS DEDSEC" in Notepad.

Before we go in to how to run it, I have to thank W_R_E_N_C_H#2035 (discord username) for making this. He is a really good coder go check him out. His YT: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFVFcQKkaYYxSe_P2_cp2uA, our discord server for coding: https://www.discord.com/y5RqTbXGyD, my discord server for gaming: https://www.discord.com/DFevACvUXB, my discord username: Stuntsalot#1799.

To run this: 

1. Have Notepad open,

2. Double click the .VBS file,

3. Watch it type!

Bear in mind, this is version 1.0.0, W_R_E_N_C_H is working on better ones.
