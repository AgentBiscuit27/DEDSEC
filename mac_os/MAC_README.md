# DEDSEC AUTOTYPER MAC COMPATIBLE

I have made a DedSec Autotyper but I have made one that is compatible with mac.

Before we go into how to run it, my coding discord server: https://www.discord.com/y5RqTbXGyD,
my gaming server: https://www.discord.com/DFevACvUXB, and my discord username: VroomVroomFerrari#1799.

__REQUIREMENTS__:Mac OS, Windows OS, Python 3.9.1 - 3.9.4 (download link here: https://www.python.org/downloads/)

> Note: This will run in your terminal, not a Text Editor (e.g. Notepad, TextEdit), I am working on a version that will open TextEdit and run it there. If you are a Windows user and you want this to run in a app, then use the Windows-only version in windows_os.

To run this:

1. Download the file.
   
2. Open terminal.

3. Type the command: `python3 DedSecMacOs.py`.

4. Watch it run! (it does it a 100 times btw)

To stop in the middle of the process, do ctrl + c.

> Note: If you are on Linux you could use this but I will make a more practical version for Linux users.
